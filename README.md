# Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data <img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/24/000000/twitter--v1.png" width="35"/> 📊

This project performs sentiment analysis on real-world tweets using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. Tweets are classified as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral** using **NLTK's VADER Sentiment Analyzer**.

---

## 📌 Project Highlights

- Cleaned tweet data (removed mentions, hashtags, URLs, stopwords, etc.)
- Applied **VADER** for rule-based sentiment scoring
- Visualized sentiment distribution using **Seaborn**
- Evaluated performance using **classification report** (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
- Built entirely using **Google Colab** (easy to run)
